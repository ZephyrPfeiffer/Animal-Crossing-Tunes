<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<hr>
 
<h3>Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, API.</h3>

<p>Before building this web application, I worked with the Animal Crossing API to figure out how the API worked and what kind of information I could retrieve from it. Once I learned the structure of the API, I built a program that would extract song information from the API and populate the webpage with songs that users could listen to. Once the logic was up and running, I constructed a user interface on the webpage that would allow users to retrieve and sort songs from the Animal Crossing API. Once the interface was set up, I cleaned up the layout of the webpage to make the webpage more appealing and easier to navigate.</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

<hr>

<p>While building the logic for retrieving songs from the API, I came across a performance issue. When working with the API, I noticed that it took a long time to retrieve information from it each time I made a request. To solve this problem, I decided to store all song information when I retrieved it so that I only needed to make a single API request. By having all the song information already, I only needed to sort through the songs and populate the webpage with all songs requested from the user.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<hr>

<p>While building this application, I learned about the importance of writing down key project information. Key information such as project issues or goals helped me keep track of what was going on in the project and what I needed to do next. I also learned about the importance of refactoring code. After building the logic for this application, I gained insight on what could be done better and made changes to improve it. The webpage recieved a huge boost in performance due to the refactoring process.</p>
